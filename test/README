Very brief, sorry...

To run the scripts, you need to set your PYTHONPATH environment variable
to include the src directory where the code was downloaded. On Unix/Linux
with something like:

   PYTHONPATH=/home/jan/voting-project/src; export PYTHONPATH
or
   setenv PYTHONPATH /home/jan/voting-project/src

depending on what shell you have. Under Windows I believe you can set it
via the Control Panel, or by editing AUTOEXEC.BAT on older windoses.

To use the code, you will also need to install the gnosis XML parser:

   http://gnosis.cx/download/Gnosis_Utils-1.1.0.tar.gz

In the directory src/evm2003/test you will find two scripts that generate
a paper ballot: lp.py prints directly to a printer, and ps.py writes
postscript to a file.

There is also a sample file vote-selection.xml that is used by lp.py
and ps.py.

The script bva.py is a simple barcode vocalization machine.

You need to edit lp.py and bva.py to reflect your local environment; see
the comments within the scripts.
